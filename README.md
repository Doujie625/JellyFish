# Jelly Fish Animation for Devin Jansa's Portfolio Page

This interactive jellyfish animation was build for my personal portfolio page written in Javascript, SVG image files and canvas HTML elements to create a unique interactive animation.

## Written in Javascript

Originaly written for JavaScript and then adaopted to run in React using the useRef hook.

## Rendered with Canvas

Using the canvas HTMl element, the jellyfish image loads an SVG spritesheet and calls on an animate function to run on a loop, displaying in the back of the page.

## SVG SpriteSheet

Each frame of the sprite sheet was first hand drawn then copnverted into `<path>` elements within Adobe Illustator. Each sprite was then appended onto a largert SVG document to create the complete spritesheet.

## Resources

Various online resources were imployed to assist in the development of this project.
